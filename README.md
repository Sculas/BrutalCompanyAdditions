# Brutal Company Additions

This mods adds multiple new events to Brutal Company![^1]

[BCPlus]: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Nips/Brutal_Company_Plus/
[^1]: For now, this mod requires [Brutal Company Plus][BCPlus] due to better code separation for hooking.<br/>
When Brutal Company Reborn is released by u-2018 (which should bring an API for custom events), this mod will switch to
that instead.
